                    <div class="textCAST"><h4>Cher Horowitz (Played by Alicia Silverstone)</h4>
                        <h5>
                            <span class="tab"></span>Cher is a sweet, if somewhat foolish, blonde teenager who lives with her father in Beverly Hills, California. She is popular with her classmates and uses her social status and skill to aid others, but these missions are not always successful. Cher has developed extensive conversational skills and excels in Mr. Hall's debate class. However, her efforts to talk her way out of trouble are not always successful, such as when she fails her driver's test due to her sub-par driving skills. Cher's knowledge is not without flaws, particularly in relation to certain elements of history and culture, such as when she calls the film Spartacus "Sporadicus" and repeatedly pronounces the word "Haitians" as "Hatey-yuns".
                        </h5>
                    </div>
                    <div class="textCAST"><h4>Melvin "Mel" Horowitz (Played by Dan Hedaya)</h4>
                        <h5>
                            <span class="tab"></span>Mel, Josh's ex-stepfather and Cher's father, is an attorney who charges $500 per hour. His brief marriage to Josh's mother ended in divorce, and Cher's own mother passed away. Mel is incredibly proud of Cher's successes and overly protective of her. He is committed to his work and frequently accepts Josh's help on his cases as an aspiring environmental lawyer. Although Cher is less useful to her father due to her incompetence, he occasionally takes aid from her. A fake envelope is seen in the movie listing Mel's last name as Hamilton (a continuity issue), and he is also named as "Mel Hamilton" in the closing credits.

                    <div class="textCAST"><h4>Josh Lucas (Played by Paul Rudd)</h4>
                        <h5>
                            <span class="tab"></span>Josh is the child of Cher's former stepbrother, Mel, and his ex-wife. Though he is from Seattle, Washington, he attends college in Los Angeles. He frequently brings up the subject as part of broader boasting since he is an environmentalist. Despite thinking himself to be better than Cher, he eventually develops empathy for her. Throughout the course of the movie, Cher comes to understand that she has feelings for Josh, but she notes that because they are already acquainted, it will be challenging for her to utilize her typical seduction strategies. They start dating towards the movie's end.

                        <h5>
                            <span class="tab"></span>Dionne, a stylish, wealthy young woman who is less inclined to make use of her fame for a good cause, is Cher's closest friend and companion. She is clever and well-spoken, and she has been in a committed relationship with Murray Duvall. Dionne claims to be a virgin (someone who has never had sexual relationships) throughout the movie, but after a terrifying incident on the motorway, she loses her virginity completely. In the television show, the sexual aspect of their relationship is not brought up until the very last episode.

                    <div class="textCAST"><h4>Tai Frasier (Played by Brittany Murphy)</h4>
                        <h5>
                            <span class="tab"></span>At Bronson Alcott High School, transfer student Tai stands out because of her unique appearance and outlook. When it is shown that Elton is more interested in Tai, Cher's attempts to make Tai popular and appealing fail. Travis, who Tai ultimately starts seeing, is her guest at Mr. Hall and Ms. Geist's nuptials. Compared to the other students, Tai has a longer history of using drugs and prostitution, and her part in the TV series is much lower than it is in the film. In the "Driving Me Crazy" episode, Brittany Murphy played a character named Jasmine.

                        <h5>
                            <span class="tab"></span>Amber, who Cher and Dionne despise, a popular girl who is constantly competing with Cher. Despite her arrogant views and teasing, she coexists with them. Amber frequently mimics Cher, and Tripp and Ginger, her parents, have a contentious relationship. As the show goes on, Amber's personality changes, and she makes friends with Cher and Dionne. They briefly reside at Cher and Mel's home after it is discovered that she has the middle name "Princess".

                        <h5>
                            <span class="tab"></span>Christian, a senior in high school, alternates between Bronson Alcott High and a Chicago-area school throughout each semester. Cher makes an effort to attract him by doing things like giving him flowers and chocolates and dressing provocatively. Cher is unaware of Christian's gay orientation as he reacts to her approaches in an effort to learn more about parties. Cher admires Christian's sense of style and his attempts to have sex with her are fruitless, but they continue to get along. The TV version does not have Christian.

                        <h5>
                            <span class="tab"></span>Murray is Dionne's long-term boyfriend and often argues with her. Murray, Dionne, and Sean Holliday make a comedic double-act and are seen to care about one another. After it is revealed that Dionne dated Sean before Murray, Murray and Sean have a falling out, but they finally make up.

                        <h5>
                            <span class="tab"></span>Elton is a wealthy, arrogant student at Beverly Hills High School who attempts to set Tai up with him. His surname is not given in the film, but one online source gives it as Tiscia. Elton does not appear in the TV series like Travis and Christian.

                        <h5>
                            <span class="tab"></span>Travis, a stoner and skater, has feelings for Tai, but their romance is thwarted by Cher's efforts to introduce Tai to Elton. Travis is a failure who frequently gets low grades and is perpetually late for class. He had the most tardies in Mr. Hall's debate class, so he prepared a speech and tried suicide. Breckin Meyer played Harrison in the episode "Do We With Bad Haircuts Not Feel?" even though Travis does not appear in the TV show.

                            <span class="tab"></span>Sean is a happy, though a little ignorant, young man who enjoys rapping and dancing and is Murray's best buddy. He frequently participates in ridiculous plots, many of which he forces Murray into. In the TV show, Sean and Cher are extremely good friends, and in the episode "Bakersfield Blues," Murray tells Sean that he had a crush on Cher. Sean, though, clarifies that their bond is purely romantic.
